# QuantumVortexPlasmaThruster Simulation

## Introduction

This repository contains the software for simulating a Quantum Vortex Plasma Thruster (QVPT). The software uses advanced numerical methods and physical modeling to simulate the state of plasma in droplets, the effects of surface tension, thermodynamics within the medium between the droplets, and the behavior of quantum vortexes. It also includes the design for a photonic spiral multiplexing system for quantum computing and thruster operation.
